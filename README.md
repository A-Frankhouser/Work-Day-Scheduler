# Work Day Scheduler

## Project Description:
    In this project we were given a basic starter code that included the bare bones of an HTML file. What we needed to do was create a work day scheduler that would have the current time, set and get text from local storage, and also give a visual representation of what times have passed, are in the future, or ones we are currently on.

## How to use:
    When you first visit this web page you will see the current time and date under the header. When you look under the time you will see time blocks starting at 9am and ending at 5pm. In each of these blocks you will see a time, a blank colored area where you can type whatever you want, and then a save button. When you type text into a time block and then click the save button it will save your text into local storage so that when you reload the page your text will still be there!
    Depending on what time it is, the time blocks will have different colors. It all depends on the current time. Any time block that are in gray will represent past time. Red time blocks will represent the current time and green time blocks will represent future events.

### The same way you save text (by pressing the save button) is how you get rid of it .

    I had some great help with this project from other students. These people were Mike Johnson, Ana Fede, Chris Lemmon, David Proto, David Parker, Joe Libadia, and Ama Frema. They really helped me with the fundamental concepts and made me look at it from a different perspective.
